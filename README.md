## Projects
### Credit Card Fraud Detection 
**Tags: Data Science, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, Preprocessing, Scikit-Learn**
- Created models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on 28 features as well as transaction amaounts
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to investigate distribution of features by transaction types and feature correlations
- Engineered features by scaling feature values, taking into account outliers
- Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifiers and compared performances and speeds
- Investigated feature reductions based on the top 5 important features from the Random Forest and PCA and compared performances

### Stock Price Prediction
**Tags: Data Science, Exploratory Data Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Correlation Analysis, Lag Analysis, Seasonal Analysis, Scikit-Learn**
- Performed Time Series Analysis on Stock Price Data to Predict Stock Closing Prices
- Performed Lag Analysis through autocorrelation plots
- Engineered features to include lag data up to five days
- Trained Random Forest and XGBoost Models to predict on the test data
- Extrapolated future stock closing prices

### Blackjack Reinforcement Learning Agent
**Tags: Reinforcement Learning, PyTorch, Deep-Q Learning**
- Created a custom environment to simulate the backjack card game that would return the state and reward values
- Created a deep learning model that would take the game state as input and output an action ("Hit", "Stand")
- Experimented with exploration vs. exploitation to allow the model to maximize rewards while also finding new strategies through random actions
- Plotted the results in real-time to show the models score over the course of thousands of games
